## ❓ 〢 About
Yashma is an popular closed-source ransomware builder formerly known as 'Ryuk' and 'Chaos'.  
It encrypts every file with AES-RSA and comes with several malicious toggleable features.  
  
The binaries code has been decompiled and fixed to its original state, making it moddable.  
Because of that, you no longer need to pay the author to get any kind of source. 😏
